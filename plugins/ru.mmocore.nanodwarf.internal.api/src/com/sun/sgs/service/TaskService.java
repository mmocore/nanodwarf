/**
 * This <code>Service</code> provides facilities for scheduling tasks to run

 * <code>scheduleNonDurableTask</code> methods defined here are used to schedule
 * tasks that are not persisted by the <code>TaskService</code> but optionally
 * invoked in a transactional context.
 * <p>
 * By default all tasks scheduled will be owned by the calling task's owning
 * identity. To create a new owning identity for a task use the
 * <code>RunWithNewIdentity</code> annotation as described in the docs for
 * <code>TaskManager</code>.
