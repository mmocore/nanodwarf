/**
 * An annotation that instructs the system to associate a new owning identity
 * with a task. All tasks run in the system are owned by some identity, and by
 * default a calling task's owning identity also owns any tasks that are
 * scheduled (using the methods on {@code TaskManager}) from that calling task.
 * Using this annotation informs the system that a new owning identity should be
 * created and used instead. This is typically useful when scheduling work that
 * represents the start of some new behavior or actor in the system.
 * <p>
 * Note that this annotation does not have the {@code Inherited} annotation. For
 * a task to be run with a new owning identity, the concrete class of the task
 * must have the {@code RunWithNewIdentity} annotation as the annotation will
 * not be inherited from a superclass or implemented interface.
 * 
 * @see TaskManager
