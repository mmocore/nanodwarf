/**
 * Helper class for operation tests. This runnable is run during the profile
 * listener's report method. It checks for a known task positiveOwner to know if
 * a operation should have been added, otherwise the operation should not be in
 * the profile report.
 * <p>
 * Synchronization with the test case is performed through an Exchanger. If an
 * AssertionError is thrown, it is assumed to have come from the JUnit framework
 * and is passed back to the test thread so it can be reported there. Otherwise,
 * JUnit does not note that the test has failed.
